# LoanDataProject
The project reads loan data and identifies which loans are most likely to default
-  Starts by reading the data from a CSV file
-  Inspected the data and reported the structure (missing values/duplicates), then removed duplicates and treated missing values
-  Finds the central tendencies and spread of the data
-  Transform categorical variables into numerical values
-  Identifies the loans with strong correlations and drops them from the dataset
-  Created a predictive, deep-learning model using Keras and TensorFlow
-  Results are the loans that have a high likelihood of defaulting
